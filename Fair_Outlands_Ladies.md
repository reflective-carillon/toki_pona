# meli pona pi ma ante

A toki pona translation of "Fair Outlands Ladies", which is a filk of "Fair Spanish Ladies" by Sir Ronan na'fical mac Connail. 
(I added some punctuation and capitalization to the English lyrics here.) 
I realize that it does not make any sense to translate an SCA filk into a conlang from 2001, 
I just had to write this down so it would stop keeping me awake. 

There are a few spots where the stress falls on the wrong syllable, 
but the number of syllables always either matches the English exactly or has one extra syllable in the second full measure of the line.

Verse:  
**a meli pona pi ma ante o kute.**  
Ah, good women of the other land, listen.  
_Farewell and adieu, you fair Outlands ladies._  
**a mi kama tu. pini tenpo li lon.**  
Ah, we will separate. The end of [our] time is here.  
_Farewell and adieu, you ladies of grace._  
**ma li wile e ni: mi a pana mute.**  
The land needs me (argh!) to give greatly.  
_For we've recieved orders to fight for our kingdom._  
**ma seli loje la mi o utala.**  
In the hot red land, let's fight.    
_Across the red desert to battle we go._  

Chorus: (first two lines are shouted)  
**a mi toki! mi mu. mi utala wawa.**  
Oh, we talk! We make animal noises. We fight powerfully.  
_And we'll rant and we'll roar like true Outlands warriors._  
**mi toki! mi mu. lon moli la lon!**  
We talk! We make animal noises. At death [we are] there!  
_We'll rant and we'll roar to death and beyond._  
**mi suli lon soweli palisa lawa.**  
We are glorious by the ruling stick-animal.  
_Until we gain glory at the foot of the stag throne,_  
**ma seli loje la mi o utala.**  
In the hot red land, let's fight.  
_across the red desert to battle we go._

Note: As toki pona is used, there are some set phrases, like "soweli palisa", 
which is taken to mean "deer". (I think. I couldn't find a reference.) 
In my opinion, "soweli palisa", stick-animal, depending on context could just as well mean "beaver", 
"a chimpanzee that uses a stick to eat termites", or "the dog with the stick (not the other dogs)". 
The meanings of set phrases are additional things that people memorize in order to speak toki pona, 
which I find disappointing given the promise of toki pona being a very small language. In this case, 
I am justifying my usage by saying that "stag throne" is a phrase that references knowledge specific 
to the Outlands anyway, so it's okay for its translation to also be a little obscure.

Note: The rhythm for "... palisa lawa" is the same as the rhythm for the third line all the other times, 
*not* the special syncopated rhythm used for "... foot of the stag thone".

Verse:  
**jan ale o moku, o pini e poki.**  
Let every person drink and finish a container.  
_Let every man here drink up a full measure._  
**jan ale o moku e telo wawa.**  
Let every person drink the liquid of power.  
_Let everyone here drink up a full bowl_  
**o seli e pilin. o awen e toki.**  
Inflame [our] hearts! Steady [our] thoughts!  
_to bolden our hearts for the oncoming battle._  
**ma seli loje la mi o utala.**  
In the hot red land, let's fight.  
_Across the red desert to battle we go._

Note: Yes, the English lyrics are "every man" the first time and "everyone" the second time, at least according to the version I have available.

**Chorus.**

Verse:  
**a lipu en selo li awen lon sinpin.**  
Oh, [my] flat thing and [my] outer layer are firm at the front.  
_I've readied my shield to stand in the warline._  
**a palisa kipisi li tu e jan.**  
Oh, [my] cutting stick cuts people in half.  
_I've readied my spear to rip and to gore._  
**mi moli la kon li awen, sama pilin.**  
If I die, [my] spirit is firm, like [my] heart.  
_I've readied my soul, should I die for my kingdom._  
**ma seli loje la mi o utala.**  
In the hot red land, let's fight.  
_Across the red desert to battle we go._

Note: kipisi = to cut; a piece. Not pu.

**Chorus.**

Verse:  
**o kulupu tawa jan moli, jan pona.**  
Gather around the dead people, the good people.  
_Now raise you a glass to the ones who have fallen._  
**o moku! o sewi e jan weka.**  
Drink! Elevate the absent people.  
_Yes, raise you a toast to those who are gone._  
**kon ona li lawa e nasin, e sona.**  
Their spirits guide [our] path and [our] knowledge.  
_Their spirits will guide us and lead us to victory._  
**ma seli loje la mi o utala.**  
In the hot red land, let's fight.  
_Across the red desert to battle we go._  

**Chorus.**   
**Chorus.**
